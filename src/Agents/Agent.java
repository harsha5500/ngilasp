/**
 * Abstract class which must be extended by all agents. The class defines that an agent is unique and has a behaviour
 * associated with it. The agents use the behaviours to achieve a set of objectives. When all the objectives are set are
 * achieved the objective flag is set by the agent. Agents also have a single or a set of utility functions to measure
 * if the agent has actually achieved its objectives.
 *
 * Every agent as a set of attributes and a set of behaviou
 * The agent may live in a universe or independent of the universe i.e. they their interaction is direct and does not
 * depend on each other's position.
